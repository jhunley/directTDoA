# directTDoA

This piece of software is JUST a GUI written for Python 2.7 designed to compute TDoA maps with GPS enabled KiwiSDR servers around the world using GNU Octave & the EXCELLENT work of Christoph Mayer @ https://github.com/hcab14/TDoA + his forked "kiwiclient" python stuff, original code by Dmitry Janushkevich @ https://github.com/dev-zzo/kiwiclient


## INSTALL AND RUN (on LINUX) Thanks Daniel E. for the work on that installation procedure

* install python 2.7

* install pip

* install GNU octave

`git clone --recursive https://github.com/llinkz/directTDoA`

`cd directTDoA`

`./setup.sh` (this script will install python modules & compile the necessary .oct file)

`python2 directTDoA.py`


## INSTALL AND RUN (on MAC OS) Thanks Nicolas M. for the procedure

* REQUIREMENT 	Xcode + Homebrew (https://brew.sh/index_fr)

Install Homebrew, in terminal : `/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"`

Install Python 2.7, in terminal : `brew install python@2`

Install GNU Octave 4.4.0, in Terminal : `brew install octave`

`git clone --recursive https://github.com/llinkz/directTDoA`

`cd directTDoA`

`./setup.sh`  (this script will install python modules & compile the necessary .oct file)

`python2 directTDoA.py`

* This python GUI code has been written and released under the "do what the f$ck you want with it" license


## WARNING
* This code may contain some silly procedures and dumb algorithms as I'm not a python guru, but it almost works so...
* This GUI may freeze sometimes, just watch for the console output and restart it..


## CHANGE LOG
* v1.00-1.50 : first working version, basic, static map, manual host adding, hardcoded coordinates, manual octave code run etc...
* v2.00 : current work, update & dynamic maps full of GPS enabled nodes, auto octave code run, easier to use
* v2.10beta : adding differents maps that can be choosed by the user, early work on SNR and tiny waterfall for nodes
* v2.20: adding favorite/blacklist node management, popup menu when clicking a node gives: add for TDoA proc + Open KiwiSDR in browser
* v2.21: reducing the map boundaries red rectangle 'sensivity' when mouse is near main window borders
* v2.30: adding node color change possible + code clean-up + adding a popup window telling you forgot to choose your map boundaries before starting the IQ recording + Popup menus are now disabled (Add/Open) if the node has no slot available + Added a gray scale map more brighter
* v2.31: bugfix on checkfilesize process
* v2.32: adding a restart GUI button
* v2.33: adding MacOS X compatibility, thx Nicolas M.
* v2.40: known points (world capitals) listing is now a file, format is 'name,lat,lon' - easier for you to add yours :-)
* v2.41: update process modified due to missing tags for some nodes in kiwisdr.com/public page
* v2.42: forgot some conditions for MacOS compatibility  oops  thanks Nicolas M. again  :-)
* v2.43: auto create the directTDoA_server_list.db file at 1st start, file does not need to be in the repo anymore
* v2.44: MacOS tested OK, code cleanup +warning about missing GPS timestamps in IQ recordings  -uglymaps +kickass NASA maps
* v2.50: some TODO list items coded or fixed
* v2.60: map update now based on John's json listing + GPS fix/min map filter + nodes are identified by IDs, no hosts anymore + no .png file creation (patch) + no more gnss_pos.txt backup and no more TDoA/gnss_pos/ purge

## TODO LIST
* dealing with nodes that forwards a xxÂ° yy' zz.z'' GEO format (gnss_pos retrieving)
* manual user map boundaries auto-geometry to respect equirectangular World view for more realistic map views
* modifying the update process to use John's new json serverlist format + adding the GPS fixes/minute info in each node point
